# Simple Cipher
DO NOT USE! THIS IS A TOY.
If you for some reason want to ignore my warning, here's how you use it. (It is not secure and can be broken easily.)
First install node.js for your platform if you don't have it (https://www.github.com/nvm-sh/nvm is the fastest way to install it on your system) 
Then clone this repo (run "git clone https://github.com/DarkSystemGit/cipher.git" in your terminal) 
And finally run:
node ./chipter.js -e --plaintext "<your message>" --key <your key> for encryption (key must be a number)
node ./chipter.js -d --ciphertext "<your message>" --key <your key> for decryption (the message here is the result of the encryption and the key being the number you put in above)
